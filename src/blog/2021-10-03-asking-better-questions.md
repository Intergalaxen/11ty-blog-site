After read the article ["How Van Gogh Found His Purpose: Heartfelt Letters to His Brother on How Relationships Refine Us"](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/01/van-gogh-purpose-letter/), I'm now about to describe how it have deepen my own approach to:

1. Asking better questions
2. Thinking deeply about my intention
3. How I define both 'value' and 'trust'
4. Think about what I, personally, are doing in KERNEL KB4? What is my question?

I can feel deeply in my heart that the principles of web3, the peer to peer architecture is what I need to contribute to as a developer. As I see musicians create wonderful art that amuses my soul, I feel strongly that my purpose in Kernel is to build out a web3 platform where musicians all around the wold can publish ther work. Interact with thoes who fancy their music peer to peer, earn royalties on their work and for arrangers to sell tickets direct through the artist on the same platform.

So how do I define value and trust? 

By value I think the key is laying within a shared intrested between peers. My music for examle have a greater value for me because because the lyrics touches me on a deep level and I produce the music to lift that I meaning that I want to convey. For someone hwo's just interested in making money out of the song the value changes. The value for me is still the same but what if I want others to be able to hear that song I will need to compromise this value to the value to a sum of money that someone have valued the song to be woth in the context of how well it would sell on the market.

Then about trust. I can only understand trust fully whan I first know what it means to lie.
