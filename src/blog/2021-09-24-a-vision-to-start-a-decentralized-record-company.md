title: A vision to start a decentralized record company
description: After a divine kick-off of KERNEL Block 4, I have now received
  strong motivation to develop a decenteralized application (dapp) during this
  8-week journey that we have now begun together. The idea with the project that
  I intend to start, is a dapp where musicians with the help of NFTs should have
  the option to put their music available to the public with a smart contract
  that acts as a record company assuming they recorded the music themselves.
