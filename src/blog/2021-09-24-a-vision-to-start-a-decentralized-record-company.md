title: A vision to start a decentralized record label
description: What if the listeners of music online would mint new coins to the
  blockchain and directly transfer the newly created coin to the creator of the
  song, only by listening and have the whole transaction be made automatically
  through a smart contract. Wouldn't that be great for the whole music industry?

After a divine kick-off of [KERNEL](https://kernel.community/en/) Block 4, I have now received strong motivation to develop a decentralized application (dapp) during this 8-week journey that we have now begun together. The idea with the project that I intend to start, is a dapp where musicians with the help of NFTs could earn their income directly from their listeners. But back to reality for a sec, who are willing to pay nowadays for listen to music online? Everything are already available for free, right? 

So here comes the morality, there are in my opinion too many parts involved for a songwriter lik me to earn money on the music I'm making. The whole music industry are full with greedy individuals who wants to make money out of your beautiful art that music is for me. As an alternative to that am I going to try building a digital portal named 'Intergalaxy space' where all independent music creators can publish their music for free and earn interest every time the song is played.

If you are interested in learning more about **Non-Fungible Tokens** (NFTs) I've linked this informative page for you:

One of the participants in KB4 works as a developer at Mintbase, which uses NFTs to sell, among other things, music. If this sounds like something that interests you, I highly recommend checking out their website:

Linda Portnoff and Paulina Modlitba discuss the future of the music industry, incredibly interesting discussions and exciting future prospects (it's in Swedish though):
