title: A vision to start a decentralized record label
description: What if the listeners of music online would mint new coins to the
  blockchain and directly transfer the newly created coin to the creator of the
  song, only by listening and have the whole transaction be made automatically
  through a smart contract. Wouldn't that be great for the whole music industry?

After a divine kick-off of KERNEL Block 4, I have now received strong motivation to develop a decenteralized application (dapp) during this 8-week journey that we have now begun together. The idea with the project that I intend to start, is a dapp where musicians with the help of NFTs should have the option to put their music available to the public with a smart contract that acts as a record company assuming they recorded the music themselves.
