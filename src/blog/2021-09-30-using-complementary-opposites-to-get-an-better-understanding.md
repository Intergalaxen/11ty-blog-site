Today I have been enriched with super wonderful discussions with fantastic participants in KERNEL's block 4 (KB4). To my surprise was the inventor of Etherium, Vitalik Buterin, our first invited guest to join us in the course, share the topic and answered lots of our questions. What an experience!

I'm so grateful for being a part in this amazing journey and to get to know other like-minded 200+ people all over the world who's also participates in this 8 week course.

To give you a sense of the content of the module for this week, I have quoted a couple of paragraphs that made a nice impression on me:

["If you want to change the world, the world will inevitably act back and change you. The results of Web 2 applications have made this clear. The greater our collective humility, the more gentle this exchange will be as Web 3 comes to life."](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern/)



["Bitcoin began with maxim **"Don't trust, verify"**.](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/trust)

[That is, trust can only begin where verification ends. Trust is only *meaningful* once we have fully understood how people can lie."](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/trust)

The things I'll take with me from this module especially is what they describe as "quantum thought" - which means thinking of things not only as good or bad, not only 0 or 1, but both in the same time. To see ["both sides *and* the entire spectrum of possible states between without grasping after certainty. This lack of certainty humbles you and it is precisely this humility, coupled with wider perspective of the total spectrum of possible outcomes which can lead you to make more effective decisions."](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern)



It's been lots of quotes now, but that's only because I couldn't say it better myself. Hope you enjoyed the reading and until next time, take care!
