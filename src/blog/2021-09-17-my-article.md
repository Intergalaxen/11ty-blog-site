title: Introduction to harmonic oscillations using a coil spring
description: An interesting phenomenon that we have just begun to look more
  closely at in the physics class is harmonic oscillations, they seem to be a
  fundamental building block in the structure of the whole universe and make me
  wonder how everything works in depth. I will now describe my thoughts that I
  am in right now in this topic and am super excited about having created this
  blog and can share these thoughts with a potential reader.

During the laboratory in the physics 2 class, we had to use a coil spring and a pendulum to define the spring constant and the gravitational constant, which may not seem so super exciting at first glance. But what began to fascinate me during the course of the laboratory were these fundamental forces that we are unconsciously influenced by in our everyday lives, every moment throughout our whole lifetime. This got me interested in researching the subject more carefully and found that these seemingly insignificant forces act on a deep plane within every single one of us living on Earth. Not only that, these forces work as far as our universe is observable with nowadays technology. Isn't that amazing?

Something that may at first seem like something insignificant can, with a little research, be a basic piece of the puzzle throughout our existence. I will continue to be interested in this subject, this was just an awakening to a greater understanding of life's marvelous mechanisms. Since the course continues throughout the fall, there will probably be more articles in the subject of physics.
This was what I had in mind today, take care of you for now and I will come back with more articles soon on other topics that I'll find interesting!
